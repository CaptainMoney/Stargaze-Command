# Stargaze-Command
Space shooter game for Stargaze Command NFT collection I created on Stargaze. 
The purpose is to make a game that allows holders of the Stargaze Command Ships collection to be able to play the game with their NFT.
This project will need to interact with a wallet, such as Keplr, to check if a player owns an NFT and renders the NFT into the game.
A larger scale game is planned where this game functions as the combat part in a grand space exploration game in the future.
